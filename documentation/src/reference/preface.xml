<title>Preface</title>

<para>This whole things is pretty rough. There are some experiments with new
step documentation. And ultimately there needs to be reference documentation about the APIs
and things. Maybe when they’re a little a little more baked and a little less runny batter.</para>

<tip>
<para>All of the standard and extension steps are included in the reference.
The steps that have descriptions providing additional, implementation-specific detail
are indicated in the table of contents with a bold font and a “✵” icon.</para>
