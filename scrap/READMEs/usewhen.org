+ Construct a tree
  + Every node has:
    + A type (node name)
    + A set of attributes
    + A use-when condition
      + The variables it refers to
      + The functions it refers to
      + The step types it depends on
    + A set of known in-scope-step types
      + A flag about whether or not that is a closed set
    + A set of in-scope-static options
      + For each option, a flag about whether or not it is a closed value

+ Every node starts with an XML node and an open perimiter
  + Get the node type and attributes
  + If use-when:
    + Is absent, expand its perimeter by expanding its children
    + Is present, leave it

+ Node types:
  + TreeNode
  + StepContainerNode
    + DeclareStepNode
    + LibraryNode
  + OptionNode
  + ImportNode

+ StepContainerNode
  + List of in-scope static options
    + Can be repeats as long as at most one is resolved
  + List of known in-scope step types
    + Is that set closed?

+ Repeat
  + Expand the perimeter
  + If a use-when is encountered
    + If it’s resolvable, resolve it
  + If no use-when was encountered, we’re done
  + If no use-when was resolved, error
