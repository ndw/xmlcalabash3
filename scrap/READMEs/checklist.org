+ [ ] Could Kotlin delegates make the AbstractElement/DeclarationContainer
  dichotomy less messy?

+ [X] If the subpipeline in p:try is a single group, don’t double-wrap it
+ [X] Use ANONYMOUS and ANONYMOUS_TYPE for name and type so they don’t have to be nullable
+ [X] Is the identify() method still useful?
+ [ ] Type check pipeline option values
+ [ ] Error reporting needs to include the location!
+ [ ] Undeclared variable in guard expression
+ [ ] Properties etc, not handled on an inline default input
+ [ ] Document not handled on a default input
+ [ ] Don’t run the steps necessary to generate default input if it isn’t needed
+ [X] The text-sort collation URI is wrong in the published library
+ [X] Capture Saxon stylesheet compilation messages (in, e.g., text-sort)
+ [X] Why isn’t the result port on p:compare primary?
+ [X] ab-cast-content-type-010.xml seems wrong
+ [X] Work out at statically, at the point of call, what steps are available
+ [ ] Apply static analysis (use/when) to pipeinfo
+ [ ] What about a use-when based on a static provided as an option
+ [X] What about an atomic declaration when resolving a use-when
  + You can’t tell until after the use-when’s have been resolved
+ [ ] Resolve use-when on elements in an inline / expand TVTs
+ [ ] Static analysis on ExpressionBinding
+ [ ] Special case the content type filter for p:identity
+ [ ] p:inline document-propties (typo) not an error
